Almost every method in this project uses recursion. I know, it's not efficient, but I'll have time later to write iterative code. Recursion is just so elegant I couldn't resist playing with it in this project

This is the most difficult and the most fun project of The Odin Project at the same time for me

I'm still not sure if I've done depth-first traversal methods correctly, because in videos on Youtube they call nodes closest to the root first, unlike mine
